					<h2 class="bold center">Rules</h2>
					<p class="justify">The game starts with each player holding five cards, four of which are Citizens and the last being either a Slave or an Emperor. Who holds which card is decided beforehand, and is played like that for three turns before switching. The game lasts for a total of twelve turns, meaning each side gets to play Emperor twice. The players choose one card from their hand and place them face-down on the table. They are then flipped over to reveal the winner of the match.</p>

					<p>The three card types are <span class="bold">Citizen</span>, <span class="bold">Emperor</span> and <span class="bold">Slave</span>.</p>

					<br>

					<h4 class="bold">Story behind</h4>

					<p class="justify">The Citizen card represents the common man, and cannot defeat the Emperor who sits at the top. It can, however, defeat the Slave, who resides at the very bottom of the system. Two citizen against each other results in a tie.</p>

					<p class="justify">The Emperor represents the one at the top of society. This card can defeat the citizen, but will lose to the Slave.</p>

					<p class="justify">The Slave is presented as the one at the very bottom of society. Seeing as how it has nothing to lose, it can overthrow the Emperor in one last attempt at revenge. This card will lose to a Citizen, but will win against the Emperor card.</p>

					<br>

					<h4 class="bold">Stats</h4>

					<p class="justify">When the Slave or Emperor card has come into play, the round is over. The one on the emperor side is more likely to win, seeing as how the opposing side only has one card that can defeat the Emperor. If the Emperor is played against a Citizen, the Emperor side wins the round. The Slave side, however, has only one chance to win; playing the Slave card when the opponent plays the Emperor. Because one cannot know which card the opponent has played until both have dealt, the Slave side has only a 1/5 chance to win, while the Emperor side has the advantage with it's 4/5.</p>
